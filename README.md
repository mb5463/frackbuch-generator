# frackbuch-generator

This script was used to generate some pages of a "Frackbuch" :)

## Dependencies

- GTk 3 / Gnome Desktop
- gnome-screenshot
- gsettings

## Why?

Maybe this is useful to someone out there.

## What about the images?

The files in the img folder were created using a patched version of CMatrix (https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix). If you decide to use those images, please credit the developers of CMatrix.
